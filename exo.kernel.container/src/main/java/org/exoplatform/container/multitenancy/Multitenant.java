package org.exoplatform.container.multitenancy;

/**
 * An element annotated with {@code @Multitenant} will be enhanced to be mutlitenant capable in eXo container.<br>
 * <br>
 * If applied to a class then it means that such class should be enhanced in special way by 
 * the container to provide per-tenant instances of the component. <br>
 * When applied to a method of the class already annotated as multitenant, then the method's 
 * return type (if it is not void) should be also enhanced to provide per-tenant
 * isolation of the returned instance in future. But take in account, such annotation on a method 
 * doesn't guaranty the returned object will be enhanced by the multitenant container in 
 * all cases. In general only interfaces and non final classes with default (empty) constructor  
 * are good candidates for such manipulation. Refer to the actual implementation of multitenancy 
 * for details of what and how can be enhanced.<br>
 * To skip such manipulation on a method use {@code @Multitenant(false)}, it can be useful if 
 * the method already supports multitenancy (natively or not requires to be such) but other methods 
 * should be still enhanced.<br>
 * It also possible to enable enhancement explicitly for only selected methods using 
 * {@code @Multitenant(explicitly=true)} on a class and then annotate target methods with {@code @Multitenant}.<br>
 * <br>
 * Example 1: Enhance all methods of the class except of {@code getInfo()}.
 * <pre>
 * {@literal @}Multitenant
 * public class AcmeComponent {
 *
 *   // This method, and optionally its return value, will be enhanced.  
 *   public AcmeData getData() {
 *     return new AcmeData();
 *   }
 *
 *   // This method will not be enhanced.
 *   {@literal @}Multitenant(false)  
 *   public InfoData getInfo() {
 *     return new InfoData();
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Example 2: enhance only explicitly selected methods.
 * <pre>
 * {@literal @}Multitenant(explicitly=true)
 * public class AcmeComponent {
 *
 *   // This method, and optionally its return value, will be enhanced.
 *   {@literal @}Multitenant  
 *   public AcmeData getData() {
 *     return new AcmeData();
 *   }
 *
 *   // This method will not be enhanced.
 *   public InfoData getInfo() {
 *     return new InfoData();
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
